\section{Introduction}
In December 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, identified as COVID-19 and the virus as SARS-CoV-2\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it}}.
COVID-19 was quickly spread to the whole country and the whole world.
According to a situation report of WHO\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200329-sitrep-69-covid-19.pdf}}, the total confirmed cases have reached 634,835 as of 29 March, 2020.

COVID-19-related studies have been mostly conducted on epidemiology based on the timeline of outbreak, e.g. transmission dynamics \cite{li2020early} and preventive measures \cite{chinazzi2020effect}.

It is well-accepted that COVID-19 inflict huge impact on public health and all the domains of economy, from spring festival till today (March 2020).
However, few studies have been conducted to analyze quantitatively the behavior pattern of people before and during the epidemics.
The wide-spread Bike Sharing System (BSS)  in China offers a possibility for analyzing such pattern of residents.

The 3rd generation of BSS emerges in China in 2015 thanks to rapid development of GIS-based and IoT-based system. 
In this BSS, bikes are no longer constrained by docking stations (so-called free floating), they often spread along the roads, congest around shopping/residential areas, which cover the most urban residents. 
As for city of Beijing, the amount of share bike reached its peak in 2017 and governors began removing excess supply afterwards. 
The demand and the supply of share bikes meet a balance in 2019, which could be a stable data source.
According to Daxue Consulting \cite{bssmodel}, in Beijing, 93\% of travels less than 5km are quicker done by bike and public transport than with the car, which suggests share bikes has a potential reflection on the local mobility of residents.

Xu et al. characterizes the BSS spatiotemporal flow and in Singapore \cite{xu2019unravel}.
Kaggle competition of predicting share bike demands \cite{kaggle}.
There are also studies of 3rd generation BSS focusing on rebalancing strategies \cite{pal2017free, ai2019deep}.

Our work aims at analyzing the differences between the patterns of epidemics and that of ordinary days in order to estimate the impact of the epidemics.

\textbf{Contribution:} people's behavior pattern, share bike usage $\to$ impact on economy.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Study area}
This study is conducted in the city of Beijing, the capital of China. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:study_area}, Beijing locates at the North China Plain, occupying an area of 16,411km$^2$ ( 39.4{\degree}-41.6{\degree}N, 115.7{\degree}-117.4{\degree}E). 
In 2019, the municipal population of Beijing have reached 21.53 million. According to Beijing Health Commission, 352 confirmed cases\footnote{\url{http://wjw.beijing.gov.cn/xwzx_20031/wnxw/202002/t20200212_1628835.html} (in Chinese)} were found in Beijing by February 10, 2020. 
As an imported metropolis, Beijing has taken measures in response to the outbreak. 
Under this circumstance, the activities of residents have been influenced and showing special spatiotemporal patterns.

\subsection{Data Sets}
(a) \textbf{BSS spatiotemporal data} Temporal positioning datasets come from 900 thousand share bikes belonging to 3 main BSS operators (Mobike, DiDi Bike, Hellobike and Ofo) in Beijing.
The datasets date from March 2018 to March 2020 (111.7 GB) and cover 1.5 million usages per day contributed by 11 million users which account for one half of the total population of Beijing.
Records contain the positioning and timing information of locking \& unlocking bikes, excluding that of rebalancing operations.
Certain districts (Chaoyang, Fengtai and Shijingshan) are not comprised in the datasets due to different policies of local governments.

(b) \textbf{The infected residential areas} was collected from the daily update on the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak provided by Beijing Health Commission. 
This data records the confirmed cases of each district from Jan 20 to Mar 5, 2020.

To characterize the behavior patterns, we select the following important referential dates:

    \caption{Comparison of share bike usages during 18:00-19:00 of year 2019 and 2020.}
    \label{fig:hour_comparison_18}
\end{figure}

We compared the share bike usage on rush hours (8:00-09:00 and 18:00-19:00) during a period of 64 days from 01 Jan to 05 March 2019 and 01 Jan to 04 March 2020 respectively (data later than 29 Feb 2020 were delayed by one day due to the leap year).
% As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:temporal_comparison}, in 2019, the usage drops down to $5\times 10^5$ because of spring festival; 
% while in 2020, the usage decreases even two thirds of that in 2019 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the following epidemics.

% We also plotted the graph of share bike usage during rush hour (8:00-10:00 and 18:00-20:00) which reflects the industrial activities.
Share bike usage on rush hours in 2019 exhibits the periodicity of social activities: high on weekdays and low on weekends, which fits our general knowledge.
However, this pattern does not appear from 10 Feb 2020 when the government declared the partial restart of certain social activities.
We suggest that the social activities were not resumed until Feb 24, which correspond the impact of epidemics still lasted till the end of the study period.
