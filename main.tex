\abstract{During the epidemics of COVID-19, not only China but the whole world is experiencing a serious crisis on public health and economy, and the epidemics have become pandemics.
As estimating the overall loss in China is a complex task, we try to reveal the behavior change of people over time \& space in order to infer the impact on daily life of and overall economy.
Spatiotemporal behavior patterns can be reflected by share bike usage because great majority of Chinese urban residents use share bikes to connect public transports and both ends of travel.
Taking records of BSS (Bike Sharing System) in Beijing, this paper characterizes not only temporal behavior patterns of share bike users: during ordinary days, holidays and the pandemic, but also spatial behavior patterns: around malls, metros, normal communities and infected communities, etc.
This paper illustrates a huge decrease of share bike use during the pandemic and discover the critical time \& places showing the significant impact on the industries and social activities.

\section{Introduction}
In December 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, identified afterwards as COVID-19 and the virus as SARS-CoV-2\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it}}.
COVID-19 was quickly spread to the whole country and the whole world.
According to a situation report of WHO\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200329-sitrep-69-covid-19.pdf}}, the total confirmed cases have reached 634,835 as of 29 March, 2020.

It is well-accepted that COVID-19 pandemic inflicts huge impact on public health and most of the domains of economy, from spring festival till today (April 2020).
COVID-19-related epidemiological studies have been mostly conducted in transmission dynamics \cite{li2020early,pitzer2009demographic} and preventive measures \cite{chinazzi2020effect,van2006today} based on the timeline of outbreak.
However, few studies have been conducted to analyze quantitatively the spatiotemporal behavior patterns of people which is essential to assess the impact on economy and society.

Data of online surveys and mobile phone positioning could be references, but they do not cover all the population especially those who care about their privacy and are not willing to offer their precise position.

Wide-spread Bike Sharing System (BSS) in China provides with a possibility for analyzing such patterns of residents.
The 3rd generation BSS emerges in China in 2015 thanks to rapid development of GIS-based and IoT-based system. 
Compared to its predecessors, bikes of the 3rd generation BSS (hereinafter referred to as BSS) are no longer constrained by docking stations (so-called free floating bikes), they are often spread along the roads, congest around shopping/residential areas and cover the most urban residents. 
As for city of Beijing, the amount of share bike reached its peak in 2017 and governors began removing excess supply afterwards. 
After two years of development and regulation of BSS, the demand and the supply of share bikes meet a balance in 2019, which could be regarded as a stable data source.
According to Daxue Consulting \cite{bssmodel}, in Beijing, 93\% of travels less than 5km are quicker done by bike and public transport than with the car, which suggests share bikes has a potential reflection on the local mobility of residents.

\section*{Related Work}
Du et al. \cite{du2018better} studies the travel patterns of BSS in Nanjing via questionnaires.
Xu et al. \cite{xu2019unravel} characterizes the BSS temporal flow and spatial distribution in Singapore.
Kaggle \cite{kaggle} competition of predicting share bike demands based on limited entries.
There are also studies of BSS focusing on rebalancing strategies \cite{pal2017free, ai2019deep}.


\textcolor{red}{reference in earth science GUO}

As far as we know, there are no studies on the period-wise spatiotemporal patterns and co-location patterns extracted from the big data of BSS (usage records).

\section*{Contribution} We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic via three aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item global view of infection in the districts of Beijing
    \item analyzing the evolution of bike usages from ordinary days to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, then to the pandemic days
    \item analyzing the co-location patterns of BSS with different types of POIs to reveal the impact on the corresponding businesses.
\end{enumerate}

    \caption{Location map and 16 administrative districts of Beijing}
    \label{fig:study_area}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Study area}
This study is conducted in the city of Beijing, the capital of China. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:study_area}, Beijing locates at the North China Plain, occupying an area of 16,411km$^2$ ( 39.4{\degree}-41.6{\degree}N, 115.7{\degree}-117.4{\degree}E). 
In 2019, the municipal population of Beijing have reached 21.53 million. According to Beijing Health Commission, 352 confirmed cases\footnote{\url{http://wjw.beijing.gov.cn/xwzx_20031/wnxw/202002/t20200212_1628835.html} (in Chinese)} were found in Beijing by February 10, 2020. 
As a population-importing metropolis, Beijing has taken measures in response to the outbreak. 
Under this circumstance, the activities of residents have been influenced and showing special spatiotemporal patterns different from ordinary days.

\subsection{Data Sets}
\textbf{BSS spatiotemporal data} Temporal positioning datasets come from 900 thousand share bikes belonging to 3 main BSS operators (Mobike, DiDi Bike, Hellobike and Ofo) in Beijing.
The datasets date from March 2018 to March 2020 (111.7 GB) and cover 1.5 million usages per day contributed by 11 million users which account for one half of the total population of Beijing.
Records of the datasets contain the positioning and timing information of locking \& unlocking bikes, excluding that of rebalancing operations.
This feature suggests that the movement of bikes are done by users.
Certain districts (Chaoyang, Fengtai and Shijingshan) are not comprised in the datasets due to different policies of local governments.

\textbf{The infected residential areas} was collected from the daily update on the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak dashboard\footnote{\url{http://wjw.beijing.gov.cn/xwzx_20031/wnxw/202003/t20200305_1679143.html} (accessed March 05, 2020, in Chinese)} provided by National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. 
This data records the confirmed cases of each district from Jan 20 to Mar 5, 2020.

\section{Result and Discussion}

To characterize the behavior patterns, we select the following important referential dates:

    \caption{Comparison of share bike usages during 18:00-19:00 of year 2019 and 2020.}
    \label{fig:hour_comparison_18}
\end{figure}

We compared the share bike usage on rush hours (8:00-09:00 and 18:00-19:00) during a period of 64 days from 01 Jan to 05 March 2019 and 01 Jan to 04 March 2020 respectively (data later than 29 Feb 2020 were delayed by one day due to the leap year).
% As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:temporal_comparison}, in 2019, the usage drops down to $5\times 10^5$ because of spring festival; 
% while in 2020, the usage decreases even two thirds of that in 2019 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the following epidemics.

% We also plotted the graph of share bike usage during rush hour (8:00-10:00 and 18:00-20:00) which reflects the industrial activities.
Share bike usage on rush hours in 2019 exhibits the periodicity of social activities: high on weekdays and low on weekends, which fits our general knowledge.
However, this pattern does not appear from 10 Feb 2020 when the government declared the partial restart of certain social activities.
We suggest that the social activities were not resumed until Feb 24, which correspond the impact of epidemics still lasted till the end of the study period.
