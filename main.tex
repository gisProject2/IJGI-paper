\abstract{During the epidemics of COVID-19, not only China but the whole world is experiencing a serious crisis on public health and economy, and the epidemics have become pandemic.
As estimating the overall loss in China is a complex task, we try to reveal the behavior change of people over time \& space in order to infer the impact on daily life of and overall economy.
Spatiotemporal behavior patterns can be reflected by share bike (SB) usage because great majority of Chinese urban residents use share bikes to connect public transports and both ends of travel.
Taking records of Bike Sharing Systems (BSSs) in Beijing, this paper characterizes not only temporal behavior patterns of share bike users: during ordinary days, holidays and the pandemic, but also spatial behavior patterns: around malls, metros, normal communities and infected communities, etc.
This paper illustrates a huge decrease of share bike use during the pandemic and discover the critical time \& places showing the significant impact on the productive and social activities.
The association of public health interventions with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak was extrapolated by conducting co-location analysis temporally. 
These findings may provide critical information on how to respond to other epidemic events.

\section{Introduction}
In December 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, identified afterwards as COVID-19 and the virus as SARS-CoV-2\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it}}.
COVID-19 quickly spread to the whole country and majority of countries worldwide.
According to a situation report of WHO\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200329-sitrep-69-covid-19.pdf}}, the total confirmed cases have reached 634,835 as of 29 March, 2020.

It is well-accepted that COVID-19 pandemic inflicts huge impact on public health and most of the domains of economy, from spring festival till today (April 2020).
COVID-19-related epidemiological studies have been mostly conducted in transmission dynamics \cite{li2020early,pitzer2009demographic} and preventive measures \cite{chinazzi2020effect,van2006today} based on the timeline of outbreak.
However, few studies have been conducted to analyze quantitatively the spatiotemporal behavior patterns of people during pandemic situations, which is essential to assess the impact on economy and society.
Ferguson et al. \cite{ferguson2020report} have studied two main strategies in the prevention of infectious diseases: \textit{suppression}, case of China and South Korea, with enormous social and economic costs which may cause secondary disasters on health and well-being in the short and longer-term;
\textit{mitigation}, case of Great Britain and the United States, may not able to deal with all those with severe disease and resulting in high mortality.
In this paper, we focus on the impact in various aspects of suppression strategy in Beijing, China.

To achieve this goal, VGI (Volunteered Geographical Information) ...
 data of online surveys and mobile phone positioning could be references, but they do not cover all the population especially those who care about their privacy and are not willing to offer their precise position.

Wide-spread Bike Sharing System (BSS) in China provides with a possibility for analyzing such patterns of residents.
The 3rd generation BSS emerges in China in 2015 thanks to rapid development of GIS-based and IoT-based system. 
Compared to its predecessors, bikes of the 3rd generation BSS (hereinafter referred to as BSS) are no longer constrained by docking stations (so-called free floating bikes), they are often spread along the roads, congest around shopping/residential areas (RAs) and cover the most urban residents. 
As for city of Beijing, the amount of share bike reached its peak in 2017 and governors began removing excess supply afterwards. 
After two years of development and regulation of BSS, the demand and the supply of share bikes meet a balance in 2019, which could be regarded as a stable data source.
According to Daxue Consulting \cite{bssmodel}, in Beijing, 93\% of travels less than 5km are quicker done by bike and public transport than with the car, which suggests share bikes has a potential reflection on the local mobility of residents.

In this study, we use big data of BSS (usage records) to measure period-wise spatiotemporal patterns and co-location patterns. 
%Results indicate that large mobility reductions have been detected associated with the onset of the COVID-19 threat and administrative restrictions.
%Correlation analysis between the temporal usage patterns and facilities locations reveals /textcolor{red}{the influence of pandemic in different phases.}

There are also studies of BSS focusing on rebalancing strategies \cite{pal2017free, ai2019deep}.

While BSS data analytics has been successfully applied in many sectors, their application in pandemic response is still at its early stages.
Moreover, due to the limited emerging understanding of the new virus and its transmission mechanisms, it remains challenging to reveal its impacts in /textcolor{red}{residents' daily lives}.
To address this issue, We use big data of BSS (usage records) to measure period-wise spatiotemporal patterns and co-location patterns. 
Results indicate that large mobility reductions have been detected associated with the onset of the COVID-19 threat and administrative restrictions.
Correlation analysis between the temporal usage patterns and facilities locations reveals /textcolor{red}{the influence of pandemic in different phases.} 

\section*{Contribution} As the pandemic of COVID-19 and the Chinese New Year meet by coincidence, we tried to avoid the influence of this national holiday, then assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and that of suppression strategy via three aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Global view of infection in the districts of Beijing
    \item Analysis of the evolution of bike usage in different phases: ordinary days, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the days of pandemic 
    \item Analysis of co-location patterns of BSS with different types of POIs to reveal the impact on the corresponding businesses
\end{enumerate}

    \caption{Location map and 16 administrative districts of Beijing}
    \label{fig:study_area}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Study area}
This study is conducted in the city of Beijing, the capital of China. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:study_area}, Beijing locates at the North China Plain, occupying an area of 16,411km$^2$ (39.4{\degree}-41.6{\degree}N, 115.7{\degree}-117.4{\degree}E). 
In 2019, the municipal population of Beijing have reached 21.53 million. According to Beijing Health Commission, 352 confirmed cases\footnote{\url{http://wjw.beijing.gov.cn/xwzx_20031/wnxw/202002/t20200212_1628835.html} (in Chinese)} were found in Beijing by February 10, 2020. 
As a population-importing metropolis, Beijing has taken measures in response to the outbreak. 
Under this circumstance, the activities of residents have been influenced and showing special spatiotemporal patterns different from ordinary days.

\subsection{Data Sets}
\textbf{BSS spatiotemporal data} Temporal positioning datasets come from 900 thousand share bikes belonging to 3 main BSS operators (Mobike, DiDi Bike, Hellobike and Ofo) in Beijing.
The datasets date from March 2018 to March 2020 (66.8 GB) and cover 1.5 million usage per day contributed by 11 million users which account for one half of the total population of Beijing.
Records of the datasets contain the positioning and timing information of locking \& unlocking bikes, excluding that of rebalancing operations.
This feature suggests that the movement of bikes are done by users.
Certain districts (Chaoyang, Fengtai and Shijingshan) are not comprised in the datasets due to different policies of local governments.

\textbf{Points Of Interest (POIs)} POIs of Beijing are collected from AutoNavi API\footnote{\url{https://lbs.amap.com/api/webservice/guide/api/georegeo} (in Chinese)}.
Each entry is identified by \texttt{object\_id}, recording the address including longitude/latitude information, and categorized by \texttt{large\_category}, \texttt{mid\_category} and \texttt{sub\_category}.
Among hundreds of categories, we chose six mid ones: RA, tech company, other company, subway station, shopping plaza and supermarkets which correspond to productive and social activities.

\end{figure}

\textbf{Locations of Confirmed Cases}
The daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases subjected to each district from Jan 20 to Mar 5, 2020 were collected from the daily update on the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak dashboard provided by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China\footnote{\url{http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml} (in Chinese)} .
According to the timeline \cite{li2020early} of the outbreak, we pick several important dates shown in Figure \ref{fig:number_of_confirmed_cases}, visualizing the evolution of the overall pandemic situation of Beijing.
To assess the overall behavior pattern changes, we picked out the locations of infected RAs (see Figure \ref{fig:locations_of_confirmed_cases}), which were retrieved from Beijing Municipal Health Commission\footnote{\url{http://wjw.beijing.gov.cn/xwzx_20031/wnxw/202003/t20200305_1679143.html} (as of March 05, 2020, in Chinese)} .

    \caption{Locations of confirmed cases in Beijing}
    \label{fig:locations_of_confirmed_cases}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{Methods}
To obtain the co-location patterns of huge amount of spatiotemporal data (66.8GB) with numerous POIs, we proceeded with GeoSpark SQL \cite{huang2017geospark}, which performs spatial queries via parallel computing on cluster computing framework Spark\footnote{\url{https://spark.apache.org/}}.
Among the spatial queries, we utilized \texttt{spatial\_join(geom1, geom2)}, querying if \texttt{geom1} is inside \texttt{geom2} and \texttt{distance\_join(geom1, geom2, dist)} querying if the distance of \texttt{geom1} and \texttt{geom2} is less than \texttt{dist}.
These queries are nearly partition independent, recomputing is needed only on the borders of partition, thus our parallel efficiency is high given proper configuration and partitioning.

\section{Result and Discussion}

\subsection{Temporal patterns of cycling activities}
To better characterize the behavior patterns with respect to the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics, we first selected the following important referential dates that could affect the virus transmission in Beijing: 

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    04 Feb 2019 & Start of Chinese Lunar New Year holiday 2019 (spring festival 2019) \\
    10 Feb 2019 & End of new year holiday 2019\\
    07 Jan 2020 & Identification of COVID-19\\
    22 Jan 2020 & Shut down of Wuhan and other 15 cities\\
    24 Jan 2020 & Start of Chinese Lunar New Year holiday 2020 (spring festival 2020)\\
    02 Feb 2020 & End of \textit{extended} New Year holiday 2020\\
    10 Feb 2020 & Partial restart of productive and social activities
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Important dates}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}

As the outbreak of COVID-19 coincides with spring festival 2020, we use Chinese Lunar New Year holiday of 2019 as comparison to assess the influence of this period on share bike usage.
It is worth noticing that Chinese Lunar New Year holidays are not equi-length, especially that of 2020, which is extended by executive order.

We compared the share bike usage on rush hours (8:00-09:00 and 18:00-19:00) during a period of 64 days from 01 Jan to 02 March 2019 and 01 Jan to 01 March 2020 respectively (data of 29 Feb and 1 March 2020 were brought backward by one day due to the leap year).
% As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:temporal_comparison}, in 2019, the usage drops down to $5\times 10^5$ because of spring festival; 
% while in 2020, the usage decreases even two thirds of that in 2019 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the following epidemics.

\textbf{Note:} In this paper, we consider SB usage follows normal distribution, of which $95\%$ confidence interval is $[\bar{x}-2\sigma,\bar{x}+2\sigma]$.
SB usage data are presented in form $\bar{x}\pm2\sigma$.

\begin{table}[H]

        \hline
        02 Jan-20 Jan 2020 & $2.58\pm1.10$ & $1.37\pm0.74$ & $12.7\pm6.3$\\

        24 Jan-02 Feb 2020 & $0.10\pm0.02$ & $0.12\pm0.03$ & $1.72\pm0.35$\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Overall comparison of year 2019 and 2020}\label{tab:overall_comparison}
\end{table}

In Table \ref{tab:overall_comparison}, the upper part shows in usual days, SB usage in 2020 in on the same level of that of 2019, suggesting SB demand is evolving in a smooth way.
However, the lower part shows the case of spring festival, SB usage drops to less than 40\% compared with the same period in 2019 which gives a rough view over the impact of the pandemic.

    \caption{Share bike usage during 18:00-19:00 of year 2019 and 2020.}
    \label{fig:hour_comparison_18}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:hour_comparison_8} and Figure \ref{fig:hour_comparison_18}, the share bike usage drop in mid-January of 2020 and early February of 2019.
During these periods, schools and workplaces were closed as part of the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday 2020.
The overall closure was then forced to be extended to mitigate the pandemic.

% We also plotted the graph of share bike usage during rush hour (8:00-10:00 and 18:00-20:00) which reflects the productive activities.
Share bike usage on rush hours exhibits the periodicity of productive activities: high on weekdays and low on weekends, which fits our general knowledge.
However, this pattern does not appear on 10 Feb 2020 when the government declared the partial restart of certain productive and social activities.
This anomaly suggests that the activities were not resumed at all until Feb 17, one week after the partial start.
which corresponds to the fact that the impact of the pandemic was lasting till the end of this study period.

\subsection{Co-location Analysis with POIs}\label{sec:colo-poi}
We studied the co-location patterns in three phases: 01 Jan to 21 Jan (before the pandemics), 10 Feb to 01 Mar (during the pandemics \& after spring festival) and 22 Jan to 09 Feb (during the pandemics \& during spring festival) as a set of comparisons of before the pandemic, during the pandemic and during spring festival 2020.

\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:bike_usage_poi} depicts the bike usage of the six chosen categories.
Phase $b$ (before) and $a$ (after) have the same duration, 21 days.     
% In abuse of definition ``convexity'', we use the comparison between the mean of $a$ and $b$ and phase $m$ (mid) to describe the curve: the curve is more bending, \textit{i.e.} impacted if ratio $c=(b+a)/2m$ is larger.
Ratio $m/b$ shows that the bike usage of all categories decreased to one quarter, and tech companies dropped the most in both value and proportion, one possible explanation is they suit best ``work from home''. 
Ratio $a/m$ shows the bike usage of all categories have recovered to some extent but far from the situation of usual time after the partial restart of activities.

\subsection{Co-location Analysis with Infected RAs}

From Figure \ref{fig:locations_of_confirmed_cases}, we noticed that, being the center of Beijing, Dongcheng and Xicheng district contain most of the infected RAs, and the confirmed time lie between 05 and 12 February.
Like in Section \ref{sec:colo-poi}, we adjusted the time intervals to match the confirmed time and carried the same snalysis on the share bike usage around infected RAs and that of surrounding RAs (within the range of 1500m of infected RAs).

From Table \ref{tab:bike_usage_infected}, it can be inferred that the infected RAs suffered the most among the listed categories according to ratio $m/b$.
Strict quarantine was practised here to mitigate the pandemic.
Surrounding RAs were also strongly impacted because of the residents got into panic and keep themselves at home.
According to ratio $a/n$, the share bike usage of infected RAs and their surrounding RAs have recovered roughly to the same level like other RAs from the pandemic.
We can conclude the residents in Beijing followed exactly the suppression strategy whether the RAs were infected or not: quarantine, cordon sanitaire and social distancing.

\subsection{Spatiotemporal patterns of cycling activities\textbf{[Guo]}}

Figure \ref{fig:full_spatial_pattern_2020} shows the spatial patterns of BSS activities from 21 Jan to 02 Mar by 4-day intervals.
The daily share-bike records are aggregated within 500-meter grids, and randered with a color ramp from grey to green to red(as is in Legend). 
%TODO Cell size;

%TODO spatial patterns: findings and underlying causes; 
(Before) Share-bike activity is widely distributed throughout the city limits, but there is significant concentration in the downtown, where .
,during,after
Between January 24 and 27, there is a dramatic drop in mobility observed in the center of this city.
The graph is dominated by green and light green corresponding to low-intensity activities (<100 records/hour), indicating that individuals still have a need to go out during this period, but unnecessary going out has been significantly reduced by the combined effects of holidays and the epidemic.

Inferred from the spatiotemporal characteristics above, the outbreak was divided into 3 phases to better reflect the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.

\textbf{Phase a}: dates before 21 Jan, 2020, are considered as the first period, when no strong COVID-19–specific interventions were imposed.

\textbf{Phase b}: dates between 22 Jan and 09 Feb, include Chinese Lunar New Year holiday 2020. During this period, traffic suspension and home quarantine were implemented for pandemics prevention purposes.

\textbf{Phase c}: is after 10 Feb, when productive and social activities restarted partially since the pandemics was migitated and under effective control.
