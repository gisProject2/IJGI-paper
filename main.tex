% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the ojurnal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\section{Introduction}
Timeline of the outbreak of coronavirus \cite{li2020early}, huge impact on public health and economy, from spring festival till today (March 2020).

3rd generation Bike Sharing System (BSS) emerges in China in 2015. As for city of Beijing, the number of sharebike reaches its peak in 2017 and people begins removing excess supply afterwards. The demand and the supply meet a balance in 2019.


\section{Related Work}
Xu et al. characterizes the BSS spatiotemporal flow and in Singapore \cite{xu2019unravel}.
Kaggle competition of predicting share bike demands \cite{kaggle}.

\subsection{Existing Methods}

\subsubsection{Our Methods}
Why this method, its merits.

\textbf{Contribution:} people's behavior pattern, share bike usage $\to$ impact on economy.

\section{Data Sets and Methods}

\subsection{Data Sets}
BSS spatiotemporal data, positioning data come from lock \& unlock of bike, which are not affected by the recycle of excess bikes.

POIs come from Gaode Map API, are classified into hundreds of categories  

Roads ...

\subsection{Methods}
Time-series analysis...

Basic statistics on the evolution over time in different zones of Beijing. 

\section{Result and Analysis}
