\abstract{During the epidemics of COVID-19, not only China but the whole world is experiencing a serious crisis on public health and economy, and the epidemics have become pandemic.
As estimating the overall loss in China is a complex task, we try to reveal the behavior change of people over time \& space in order to infer the impact on daily life of and overall economy.
Spatiotemporal behavior patterns can be reflected by share bike (SB) usage because great majority of Chinese urban residents use SsB to connect public transports and both ends of travel.
Taking records of Bike Sharing Systems (BSSs) in Beijing, this paper characterizes not only temporal behavior patterns of SBs users: during ordinary days, holidays and the pandemic, but also spatial behavior patterns: around malls, metros, normal communities and infected communities, etc.
This paper illustrates a huge decrease of SBs use during the pandemic and discover the critical time \& places showing the significant impact on the productive and social activities.
The association of public health interventions with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak was extrapolated by conducting co-location analysis temporally. 
These findings may provide critical information on how to respond to other epidemic events.

\section{Introduction}
In December 2019, a local outbreak of pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China, identified afterwards as COVID-19 and the virus as SARS-CoV-2\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it}}.
COVID-19 quickly spread to the whole country and majority of countries worldwide.
According to a situation report of WHO\footnote{\url{https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200329-sitrep-69-covid-19.pdf}}, the total confirmed cases have reached 634,835 as of 29 March, 2020.

It is well-accepted that COVID-19 pandemic inflicts huge impact on public health and most of the domains of economy, from spring festival till today (April 2020).
COVID-19-related epidemiological studies have been mostly conducted in transmission dynamics \cite{li2020early,pitzer2009demographic} and preventive measures \cite{chinazzi2020effect,van2006today} based on the timeline of outbreak.
However, few studies have been conducted to analyze quantitatively the spatiotemporal behavior patterns of people during pandemic situations, which is essential to assess the impact on economy and society.
Ferguson et al. \cite{ferguson2020report} have studied two main strategies in the prevention of infectious diseases: \textit{suppression}, case of China and South Korea, with enormous social and economic costs which may cause secondary disasters on health and well-being in the short and longer-term;
\textit{mitigation}, case of Great Britain and the United States, may not able to deal with all those with severe disease and resulting in high mortality.
In this paper, we focus on the impact in various aspects of suppression strategy in Beijing, China.

To achieve this goal, VGI (Volunteered Geographical Information) plays an important role, in which online surveys and mobile phone positioning data could be references, but they do not cover all the population especially those who care about their privacy and are not willing to offer their precise position.

Wide-spread Bike Sharing System (BSS) in China provides with a possibility for analyzing such patterns of residents.
The 3rd generation BSS emerges in China in 2015 thanks to rapid development of GIS-based and IoT-based system. 
Compared to its predecessors, bikes of the 3rd generation BSS (hereinafter referred to as BSS) are no longer constrained by docking stations (so-called free floating bikes), they are often spread along the roads, congest around shopping/residential areas (RAs) and cover the most urban residents. 
As for city of Beijing, the amount of share bikes (SBs) reached its peak in 2017 and governors began removing excess supply afterwards. 
After two years of development and regulation of BSS, the demand and the supply of SBs meet a balance in 2019, which could be regarded as a stable data source.
According to Daxue Consulting \cite{bssmodel}, in Beijing, 93\% of travels less than 5km are quicker done by bike and public transport than with the car, which suggests SBs has a potential reflection on the local mobility of residents.

In this study, we use big data of BSS (usage records) to measure period-wise spatiotemporal patterns and co-location patterns. 
%Results indicate that large mobility reductions have been detected associated with the onset of the COVID-19 threat and administrative restrictions.
%Correlation analysis between the temporal usage patterns and facilities locations reveals /textcolor{red}{the influence of pandemic in different phases.} 

\section*{Related Work}

There are also studies of BSS focusing on rebalancing strategies \cite{pal2017free, ai2019deep}.

While BSS data analytics has been successfully applied in many sectors, their application in pandemic response is still at its early stages.
Moreover, due to the limited emerging understanding of the new virus and its transmission mechanisms, it remains challenging to reveal its impacts in /textcolor{red}{residents' daily lives}.
To address this issue, We use big data of BSS (usage records) to measure period-wise spatiotemporal patterns and co-location patterns. 
Results indicate that large mobility reductions have been detected associated with the onset of the COVID-19 threat and administrative restrictions.

\section*{Contribution} As the pandemic of COVID-19 and the Chinese New Year meet by coincidence, we tried to avoid the influence of this national holiday, then assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and that of suppression strategy via three aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Global view of infection in the districts of Beijing
    \item Analysis of the evolution of bike usage in different phases: ordinary days, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the days of pandemic 
    \item Analysis of co-location patterns of BSS with different types of POIs to reveal the impact on the corresponding businesses
\end{enumerate}

    \label{fig:study_area}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Study area}
This study is conducted in the city of Beijing, the capital of China. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:study_area}, Beijing locates at the North China Plain, occupying an area of 16,411km$^2$ (39.4{\degree}-41.6{\degree}N, 115.7{\degree}-117.4{\degree}E). 
In 2019, the municipal population of Beijing have reached 21.53 million. According to Beijing Health Commission, 352 confirmed cases\footnote{\url{http://wjw.beijing.gov.cn/xwzx_20031/wnxw/202002/t20200212_1628835.html} (in Chinese)} were found in Beijing by February 10, 2020. 
As a population-importing metropolis, Beijing has taken measures in response to the outbreak. 
Under this circumstance, the activities of residents have been influenced and showing special spatiotemporal patterns different from ordinary days.

\subsection{Data Sets}
\textbf{BSS spatiotemporal data} Temporal positioning datasets come from 900 thousand SBs belonging to 3 main BSS operators (Mobike, DiDi Bike, Hellobike and Ofo) in Beijing.
The datasets date from March 2018 to March 2020 (66.8 GB) and cover 1.5 million usage per day contributed by 11 million users which account for one half of the total population of Beijing.
Records of the datasets contain the positioning and timing information of locking \& unlocking bikes, excluding that of rebalancing operations.
This feature suggests that the movement of bikes are done by users.
Certain districts (Chaoyang, Fengtai and Shijingshan) are not comprised in the datasets due to different policies of local governments.

\textbf{Points Of Interest (POIs)} POIs of Beijing are collected from AutoNavi API\footnote{\url{https://lbs.amap.com/api/webservice/guide/api/georegeo} (in Chinese)}.
Each entry is identified by \texttt{object\_id}, recording the address including longitude/latitude information, and categorized by \texttt{large\_category}, \texttt{mid\_category} and \texttt{sub\_category}.
Among hundreds of categories, we chose six mid ones: RA, tech company, other company, subway station, shopping plaza and supermarkets which correspond to productive and social activities.

\textbf{Locations of Confirmed Cases}
The daily counts of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases subjected to each district from Jan 20 to Mar 5, 2020 were collected from the daily update on the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak dashboard provided by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China\footnote{\url{http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml} (in Chinese)} .
According to the timeline \cite{li2020early} of the outbreak, we picked several important dates shown in Figure \ref{fig:number_of_confirmed_cases}, visualizing the evolution of the overall pandemic situation of Beijing.
To assess the overall behavior pattern changes, we picked out the locations of infected RAs (see Figure \ref{fig:locations_of_confirmed_cases}), which were retrieved from Beijing Municipal Health Commission\footnote{\url{http://wjw.beijing.gov.cn/xwzx_20031/wnxw/202003/t20200305_1679143.html} (as of March 05, 2020, in Chinese)} .

\end{figure} 

\section{Tools and Methods}
\subsection{Parallel Computing}
Traditional geospatial tools such as PostGIS, QGIS are no longer able to deal with large-scale spatial queries huge amount of BSS spatiotemporal data (66.8GB) due to limited of computer performance stand-alone machine.
To obtain the co-location patterns in such datasets with numerous POIs, we proceeded with GeoSpark SQL \cite{huang2017geospark}, which performs spatial queries via parallel computing on cluster computing framework Spark\footnote{\url{https://spark.apache.org/}}.
Among the spatial queries, we utilized \texttt{spatial\_join(geom1, geom2)}, querying if \texttt{geom1} is inside \texttt{geom2} and \texttt{distance\_join(geom1, geom2, dist)} querying if the distance of \texttt{geom1} and \texttt{geom2} is less than \texttt{dist}.
These queries are nearly partition independent, recomputing is needed only on the borders of partition, thus our parallel efficiency is high given proper configuration and partitioning.

\subsection{Phase Classification}\label{sec:phase_classification}
In machine learning, it is often demanded to minimize the predefined loss function to perform the best classification such that elements within the same cluster are similar and elements across clusters are different.

Likewise, we try to divide the study period into phases which have resembling SB usage.

\begin{Definition}[k-segmentation]
Let $X=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_N\}$ be a time serie of length $N$.
Given positive integer $k<N$ and index set $\mathbf{T}=\{n_0,\ldots,n_k\}$ with $n_0=0$, $n_k=N$ and $\forall i$, $n_i<n_{i+1}$, a k-segmentation of $X$ is the set of time series $X_i=\{x_{n_i+1},\ldots,x_{n_{i+1}}\}$ where $0\leq i\leq k-1$.
\end{Definition}

To evaluate the quality of k-segmentation, we use $\sigma=\sum_{i=1}^{k}{\sigma_i}$ as loss function where $\sigma_i$ is the standard deviation of division $X_i$. %$\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x-\bar{x})^2}}$ 
The goal is to find the best $T$ to minimize $\sigma$, i.e. $\arg\min_{\mathbf{T}}\sigma(\mathbf{T})$.
This problem is solved in time $O(N^2k)$ \cite{terzi2006efficient}.
In case $k$ and $N$ are small, the optimum can be found via exhaustive search.

\section{Result and Discussion}

\subsection{Temporal patterns of cycling activities}
To better characterize the behavior patterns with respect to the COVID-19 epidemic dynamics, we first selected the following important referential dates in Table \ref{tab:important_dates} that could affect the virus transmission in Beijing: 

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    04 Feb 2019 & Start of Chinese New Year holiday 2019 (spring festival 2019) \\
    10 Feb 2019 & End of new year holiday 2019\\
    07 Jan 2020 & Identification of COVID-19\\
    22 Jan 2020 & Shut down of Wuhan and other 15 cities\\
    24 Jan 2020 & Start of Chinese New Year holiday 2020 (spring festival 2020)\\
    02 Feb 2020 & End of \textit{extended} New Year holiday 2020\\
    10 Feb 2020 & Partial restart of productive and social activities
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Important dates}
    \label{tab:important_dates}
\end{table}

As the outbreak of COVID-19 coincides with spring festival 2020, we use Chinese New Year holiday of 2019 as comparison to assess the influence of this period on SB usage.
It is worth noticing that Chinese New Year holidays are not equi-length, especially that of 2020, which is extended by executive order.

We compared the SB usage on rush hours (8:00-09:00) during a period of 64 days from 01 Jan to 02 March 2019 and 01 Jan to 01 March 2020 respectively (data of 29 Feb and 1 March 2020 were brought backward by one day due to the leap year 2020).
% As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:temporal_comparison}, in 2019, the usage drops down to $5\times 10^5$ because of spring festival; 
% while in 2020, the usage decreases even two thirds of that in 2019 due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and the following epidemics.


% \begin{figure}[ht]

%     \label{fig:temporal_comparison}
% \end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:hour_comparison_8} % and Figure \ref{fig:hour_comparison_18}
 illustrate the temporal evolution of SB usage.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figures/hour_8.eps}
    \caption{SB usage during 08:00-09:00 of year 2019 and 2020.}
    \label{fig:hour_comparison_8}
\end{figure}
% \begin{figure}[ht]
%     \centering
%     \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figures/hour_18.eps}
%     \caption{SB usage during 18:00-19:00 of year 2019 and 2020.}
%     \label{fig:hour_comparison_18}
% \end{figure}

The SB usage drops in mid-January of 2020 and early February of 2019.
During these periods, schools and workplaces were closed as part of the Chinese New Year holiday 2020.
The overall closure was then forced to be extended to mitigate the pandemic.

% We also plotted the graph of SB usage during rush hour (8:00-10:00 and 18:00-20:00) which reflects the productive activities.
SB usage on rush hours exhibits the periodicity of productive activities: high on weekdays and low on weekends, which fits our general knowledge.
However, this pattern does not appear on 10 Feb 2020 when the government declared the partial restart of certain productive and social activities.
This anomaly suggests that the activities were not resumed at all until Feb 17, one week after the partial restart, corresponding to the fact that the impact of the pandemic was lasting till the end of our study period.

Table \ref{tab:overall_comparison} gives a rough quantitative view over the impact of the pandemic.

\textbf{Note:} In this paper, we consider SB usage follows normal distribution, of which $95\%$ confidence interval is $[\bar{x}-2\sigma,\bar{x}+2\sigma]$.
SB usage data are presented in the form $\bar{x}\pm2\sigma$.

\begin{table}[ht]

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
        \hline

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Overall comparison of year 2019 and 2020}\label{tab:overall_comparison}
\end{table}


The upper part shows in ordinary days, SB usage in 2020 in on the same level of that of 2019, suggesting SB demand is evolving in a smooth way.
However, the lower part shows the case of spring festival, overall SB usage drops to less than 40\% compared with the same period in 2019, suggesting companies stopped working due to spring festival like the case of 2019, and social activities also halted. 

\subsection{Co-location Analysis with POIs}\label{sec:colo-poi}

From the previous section, it is implied the dates in Table \ref{tab:important_dates} may not be the optimal boundaries of different phases, for example Feb 17 does not appear.
We computed the best phase classificationm using definition in Section \ref{sec:phase_classification}.
We classified the period into three phases: before pandemics, during pandemics, pandemics mitigated.
Here $k=3$ and $N=64$, we found the best classified phases using exhaustive search and assign them with reasonable explanations: 01 Jan-21 Jan (before the pandemic), 22 Jan-16 Feb (critical phase of the pandemic) and 17 Feb-01 Mar (epidemics mitigated).
We computed then the BS usage in these phases.

Table \ref{tab:bike_usage_poi} depicts the bike usage of the six chosen categories.
Phase $a$ and $b$ have the same duration, 21 days.     
% In abuse of definition ``convexity'', we use the comparison between the mean of $a$ and $b$ and phase $m$ (mid) to describe the curve: the curve is more bending, \textit{i.e.} impacted if ratio $c=(b+a)/2m$ is larger.
Ratio $b/a$ shows that the bike usage of all categories decreased to one quarter, and tech companies dropped the most in both value and proportion, one possible explanation is they suit best ``work from home''. 
Ratio $c/a$ shows the bike usage of all categories have recovered to some extent but far from the situation of usual time after the partial restart of activities.

\subsection{Co-location Analysis with Infected RAs}

From Figure \ref{fig:locations_of_confirmed_cases}, we noticed that, being the center of Beijing, Dongcheng and Xicheng district contain most of the infected RAs, and the confirmed time lie between 05 and 12 February.
Like in Section \ref{sec:colo-poi}, we adjusted the time intervals to match the confirmed time and carried the same snalysis on the SB usage around infected RAs and that of surrounding RAs (within the range of 1500m of infected RAs).

\begin{table}[ht]

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Bike usage in different phases of infected RAs and that of surrounding RAs.}
    \label{tab:bike_usage_infected}
\end{table}

From Table \ref{tab:bike_usage_infected}, it can be inferred that the infected RAs suffered the most among the listed categories according to ratio $b/a$.
Strict quarantine was practised here to mitigate the pandemic.
Surrounding RAs were also strongly impacted because of the residents got into panic and keep themselves at home.
According to ratio $c/a$, the SB usage of infected RAs and their surrounding RAs have recovered roughly to the same level like other RAs from the pandemic.
We can conclude the residents in Beijing followed exactly the suppression strategy whether the RAs were infected or not: quarantine, \textit{cordon sanitaire} and social distancing.

\subsection{Spatiotemporal patterns of cycling activities}

Figure \ref{fig:full_spatial_pattern_2020} shows the spatial patterns of BSS activities from 21 Jan to 02 Mar by 4-day intervals, which is consistent with the changes detected in Figure \ref{fig:hour_comparison_8}. % and \ref{fig:hour_comparison_18}.
The daily share-bike records are aggregated within 500-meter grids, and rendered with a color ramp from grey to green to red (as is in Legend).

Before 21 Jan, 2020, SB activities were widely distributed throughout the city limits, with a significant concentration in downtown area, which is orange or even red in color, corresponding to high-intensity activities (up to 500-1000 records/hour).
These patterns could be regarded as a comprehensive reflection of the activities of the individuals in these regions, and used as a reference to compare with that during COVID-19 pandemic.

After the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a dramatic drop in mobility since 25 Jan, which was also the begining of the Chinese New Year holidays.
High-intensity activities could hardly be recognized in the subfigures between 25 Jan to 02 Feb. 
These subfigures are dominated by green and light green corresponding to low-intensity activities (<100 records/hour), indicating that individuals have demands to go out during this period, but unnecessary going-out has been significantly reduced by the combined effects of holidays and the epidemic.
Status continued until 09 Feb, when the spread of COVID-19 was slowered down by imposing control measures including social distancing and home quarantine, and productive and social activities were allowed to restart partially.

Subfigures during 10 Feb to 01 Mar, 2020, show a gradual increase in the mobility of the share-bikes, but only restored around \textcolor{red}{30\% of the pre-epidemic levels}.
It is worth noticing that only slight differences could be observed between weekdays and weekends before 17 Feb and the weekday-weekend oscillation returned afterwards.

There is a higher demand for share-bikes on workdays in the downtown area as before.
However, the high-intensity areas shrinked on weekends, implying that residents were more inclined to reduce the risk of increased exposure by going outside under the threat of COVID-19.

Inferred from the spatiotemporal characteristics above, the outbreak was divided into 3 phases to better reflect the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.

\textbf{Phase a}: dates before 21 Jan, 2020, are considered as the first period, when no strong COVID-19–specific interventions were imposed.

\textbf{Phase b}: dates between 22 Jan and 17 Feb, include Chinese New Year holiday 2020. During this period, traffic suspension and home quarantine were implemented for pandemics prevention purposes.

\textbf{Phase c}: is after 10 Feb, when productive and social activities restarted partially since the pandemics was migitated and under effective control.

In the following sections, we will focus on …… and investigate ……

\subsection{Discussions}
\textbf{Part 1. Comparison with data from the same period in 2019.}

Both Chinese New Year holiday shutdowns and pandemic resulted in the aforementioned mobility decrease.
Therefore, comparison was conducted with data from the same period in 2019, thus removing the impact of the Chinese New Year holiday and evaluating the specific influence of the COVID-19.  
The average values of aggregated daily share-bikes records from each pandemic phase were reported.
Figure \ref{fig:compare_2019_and_2020} delineates the results corresponding to 2020, 2019, and annual difference in between.
Panel (a) - (c) were consistent with the daily patterns during different pandemic stages presented in the previous section.
Panel (d) - (f) summarized the averaged share-bike intensity during the same time-interval as \textbf{phase a} in 2019, showing similar spatial patterns as 2020. 
In Panel (g) - (i), (Comparable numbers of positive (Red colored) and negative(blue colored) area could be observed from annual difference presented in panel (g). These discrepancies have relatively low values which could be attributed to the fluctuation of regional bike usages requirements.

There existed significant discrepancies in bike usages between year 2019 and 2020 during PHASE B and C, because of the COVID-19. 
The Spring Festival holidays provide a chance for citizens to visit friends and enjoy family gethering.
Therefore the holidays shutdowns reduced mobility in 2019, but high-intensity activities could still be found in the urban districtss from panel(e). 
Correspondingly, activities were in a state of complete suppression in 2020. 
The difference map in panle(h) highlighted the fact that, under the impact of COVID-19, demands for outings were reduced for safe purposes.

In previous years, panel(f) indicated that mobility would instantly return to pre-festival levels or more widespread as a result of the influx of migrant workers after holiday.
According to panel(c), the rehabilitation was in progress, but much slower during epidemic mitigated period.  
The remarkable difference referred from panel(i) verified this sustained impact on citizens' daily lives.


\textbf{Part 2. Relationships between cycling activities and confirmed cases with respect to epidemic phases} 

This part aims to characterize disease-spreading individuals behavior patterns by evaluating share-bike usages with respect to different pandemic periods.%thus provide reference for authorities to gradually lift the most restrictive measures with more precision and confidence.

Figure \ref{fig:BSS_phase1_2} shows the share-bike usages in phase b, i.e., the quanratine period.
Same as previous sections, aggregated share-bike records were randered with a color ramp from grey to green to red.
The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each district was represented by the size of blue circle.
When comparing the panels from left to right with dates varying from 25 Jan to 08 Feb, respectively, we observe that the aggregated share-bike intensity gradually decreased with increasing number of confirmed cases and then remained at low values.
The aggregated share-bike intensity in the downtown area changed from red to green.
%The reason could be attributed to the individuals' response against the high infectious risk and government's measures.
Starting on January 25, 2020, highly restrictive measures were implemented by the local government.
In addition, individuals were asked to follow a series of social distancing measures.
As a result, the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases was effectively suppressed.

Figure \ref{fig:BSS_phase_3} depicts the share-bike usages in phase c, when productive and social activities were allowed to restart partially.
%aim to identify and characterize disease-spreading human interactions, thus allowing authorities to gradually lift the most restrictive measures with more precision and confidence.
During this epidemic mitigated period, aggregated share-bike intensity gradually rebounded with stable accumulated confirmed cases, which can be inferred from panel(a)-(c).
The recovery of city is unbalanced in the spatial domain.
An increase could be observed in the urban districtss, wheras changes were not significant in other areas.
A reduction in mobility on weekends could be inferred from comparison between panel(d) and (e), which was attributed to individuals' awareness to the risk of infection.
It should be highlighted that counts of accumulated confirmed cases stayed stable substantially across this period, suggesting control measures were effective and necessary in containment of the spread of COVID-19 during city's resilience.  
\textcolor{red}{After the epidemic is effectively controlled, cycling activities increased due to the rework requirements, which can be inferred from visualization. The difference is obvious comparing workday and weekend.}

\section{Conclusion}

Motivated by the current COVID-19 outbreak and rapid development in Share-bike system, this paper represents the period-wise spatio-temporal patterns and co-location patternsof the Share-bikes during the pandemic in Beijing, China.
The influences of pandemic on individuals' mobility and city's rehabilitation process have been investigated.

\textcolor{red}{These results could facilitate research and inform policy making in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, and help to prevent the emergence of pandemics.} 
However, the government implemented multiple interventions at the same time or in a short timeframe to control the outbreak, therefore individual strategies could not be evaluated.
Correlation analysis was performed based on confirmed cases data extracted from the infectious disease reporting system. 
With additional information concerning epidemiological characteristics, spatiotemporal epidemic model is planned to predict the spread of pandemic in the future.
